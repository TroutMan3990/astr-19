#Create a Jupyter Notebook where, in separate cells, you define functions that return sin(x) and cos(x).  
#Use Markdown cells to comment your Notebook, and describe what each function does. 
#Create a third Python cell that will tabulate sin(x) and cos(x) 
#using these previously defined functions vs. x, 
#where x is tabulated between 0 and 2pi with a thousand entries. 
#Write a fourth Python cell that will use a for loop to print out the first 10 values of x, sin(x), and cos(x) in columns.
